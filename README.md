### Weightless Accessories - Project Zomboid Mod

- Mod changes weight of "useless" clothing items to 0.0
- Mod should be compatible with any modded items.
- Mod will skip any items that are registered in TweakItemData array.
- Mod doesn't intend to change the weight of items with purpose, so stuff like socks, watches or belts are untouched.
